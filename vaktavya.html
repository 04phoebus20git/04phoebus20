          I hear voices.
          Quite many of us do, especially those of us who have experimented or habituated ourselves with the use of psychoactive drugs.
          I did a whole lot of that over the course of more than three decades.

          Plus, I was raised in an environment which often favored, but at least always kept interest with, Eastern and mystic religiosity.
          Reception to voices is a very well-respected tradition in the faiths of India, and so it was very easy for me to think that I was engaging in progressive yoga as I was learning to interact with the voices I was hearing, even though drug use is more unorthodox and often a significant hindrance.
          Combining the two, I have in the course of my life, sometimes for better, though often for worse, developed a sense of being ordinary enough though quite conversant with unseen voices.

          I’ve encountered a great deal of the accusation of brain damage, and certainly that is a real factor, but probably only with the alcohol, considering that LSD and DXM (dextromethorphan) were my other two drugs of choice.
          The question of salvability according to varieties of Christian judgment has been repeated many times, and I have wrestled with my own conscience extensively.
          However, I did eventually develop a very careful conversation in prayer with God, and learned to contextualize my own visions and beliefs by honoring the many valid principles of gentle and humane truth as are given by a virtual eternity of sages, saints, saviors, and the like.
