          I hear voices.
          Quite many of us do, especially those of us who have experimented or habituated ourselves with the use of psychoactive drugs.
          I did a whole lot of that over the course of more than three decades.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Plus, I was raised in an environment which often favored, but at least always kept interest with, Eastern and mystic religiosity.
          Reception to voices is a very well-respected tradition in the faiths of India, and so it was very easy for me to think that I was engaging in progressive yoga as I was learning to interact with the voices I was hearing, even though drug use is more unorthodox and often a significant hindrance.
          Combining the two, I have in the course of my life, sometimes for better, though often for worse, developed a sense of being ordinary enough though quite conversant with unseen voices.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I’ve encountered a great deal of the accusation of brain damage, and certainly that is a real factor, but probably only with the alcohol, considering that LSD and DXM (dextromethorphan) were my other two drugs of choice.
          The question of salvability according to varieties of Christian judgment has been repeated many times, and I have wrestled with my own conscience extensively.
          However, I did eventually develop a very careful conversation in prayer with God, and learned to contextualize my own visions and beliefs by honoring the many valid principles of gentle and humane truth as are given by a virtual eternity of sages, saints, saviors, and the like.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I don’t mean to justify any of this too much, and I certainly have many errors and even gross offenses in my life, as even minor research would tell of me.
          But I’m prefacing that the consideration of <i>vaktavya</i> and <i>avaktavya</i> is a pretty natural step in the life that I have lived.
          My present relative sobriety (merely caffeine) is helping me to give a milder quality of attention to the detail of how to address my interests in a way that is somewhat safe.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          My work with voices has coincided with my development of theism, and I should describe that here.
          When I was very young, I had a simple faith in monotheistic God as taught by Christians, but also some exposure to Hindu or Vedic religion, which includes gods and saviors like Viṣṇu, Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, and Buddha.
          At the age of eighteen I joined a Śaiva (Śiva worshiping) meditation path, but converted within three years to Vaiṣṇavism (the worship of Viṣṇu) after reading the <i>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</i> and then the <i>Bhagavad-Gītā</i>.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I have stayed with Vaiṣṇava theology ever since, but in years of intensive drug use I began to imagine that I could possibly be some demigod myself, in my initial thinking probably a Brahmā but then later an Agni.
          I was always able to maintain the distinction between my self and Viṣṇu as the Supersoul within my heart and the God above me, even when I learned that the gentle standard of soulfulness within our Solar System combines distinction between above and below with identification of the two also.
          God (and Goddess) above us can recognize much better than we do, both the distinction and identity, much like parents with their children or teachers with their students.
        </div>

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          These brief stories I’m sharing about my alchemical and theurgical history are only meant to give a sense of the developmental and psychological environment I’ve worked my own version of maturation within.
          Any of us have our stories in life, and in regards to voices, there are innumerable reasons why and means by which voices might speak with those of us who are often partially willing audience.
          But these details here show what type of subject matter my own conversations might have elaborated and meditated upon.
