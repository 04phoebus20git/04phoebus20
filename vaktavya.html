          I hear voices.
          Quite many of us do, especially those of us who have experimented or habituated ourselves with the use of psychoactive drugs.
          I did a whole lot of that over the course of more than three decades.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Plus, I was raised in an environment which often favored, but at least always kept interest with, Eastern and mystic religiosity.
          Reception to voices is a very well-respected tradition in the faiths of India, and so it was very easy for me to think that I was engaging in progressive yoga as I was learning to interact with the voices I was hearing, even though drug use is more unorthodox and many times a significant hindrance.
          Combining the two, I have in the course of my life, sometimes for better, though often for worse, developed a sense of being ordinary enough though quite conversant with unseen voices.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I’ve encountered a great deal of the accusation of brain damage, and certainly that is a real factor, but probably only with the alcohol, considering that LSD and DXM (dextromethorphan) were my other two drugs of choice.
          The question of salvability according to varieties of Christian judgment has been repeated many times, and I have wrestled with my own conscience extensively.
          However, I did eventually develop a very careful conversation in prayer with God, and learned to contextualize my own visions and beliefs by honoring the many valid principles of gentle and humane truth as are given by a virtual eternity of sages, saints, saviors, and the like.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I don’t mean to justify any of this too much, and I certainly have many errors and even gross offenses in my life, as even minor research would tell of me.
          But I’m prefacing that the consideration of <i>vaktavya</i> and <i>avaktavya</i> is a pretty natural step in the life that I have lived.
          My present relative sobriety (merely caffeine) is helping me to give a milder quality of attention to the detail of how to address my interests in a way that is somewhat safe.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          My work with voices has coincided with my development of theism, and I should describe that here.
          When I was very young, I had a simple faith in monotheistic God as taught by Christians, but also some exposure to Hindu or Vedic religion, which includes gods and saviors like Viṣṇu, Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, and Buddha.
          At the age of eighteen I joined a Śaiva (Śiva worshiping) meditation path, but converted within three years to Vaiṣṇavism (the worship of Viṣṇu) after reading the <i>Viṣṇu Purāṇa</i> and then the <i>Bhagavad-Gītā</i>.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I have stayed with Vaiṣṇava theology ever since, but in years of intensive drug use I began to imagine that I could possibly be some demigod myself, in my initial thinking probably a Brahmā but then later an Agni.
          I was always able to maintain the distinction between my self and Viṣṇu (the Supersoul within my heart, and God above me), even when I learned that the gentle standard of soulfulness within our Solar System combines distinction between above and below with identification of the two also.
          God (and Goddess) above us can recognize much better than we do, both the distinctions and the identities, much like parents with their children or teachers with their students.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          These brief stories I’m sharing about my alchemical and theurgical history are only meant to give a sense of the developmental and psychological environment I’ve worked my own version of maturation within.
          Any of us have our stories in life, and in regards to voices, there are innumerable reasons why and means by which voices might speak with those of us who are often partially willing audience.
          But these details here show what type of subject matter my own conversations might have elaborated and meditated upon.

          For the last two decades (1998 to 2016), my effort has been referenced in a cataphatic mantra I came up with to help me focus, “affirmation is my one and only one solution.”
          I examined any language I might have been studying, encountering, or otherwise trying to work with, and tried to consider what any of its meanings might be in the context of its <i>yes</i>’s more than its <i>no</i>’s.
          This practice helped me a great deal, and I feel that I have a greater philosophical maturity to build upon at this stage of my life.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Some difficulties have accompanied this effort, where some of the affirmations I was drawing my beliefs from were actually hidden, and many times probably for some level of good reason.
          I occasionally made accusations, and even acted on my beliefs in ways that made some people afraid of how far I would go with any insistence upon partial truths as being representative of a soul’s interest with me.
          But I learned quite a bit about how life works around us and where we can go if we choose to upgrade our lives from these very humble beginnings.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          As I’m entering a new phase of my own evolution with the distinction of <i>advocation</i> from <i>protest</i>, I have to be even more careful than I’ve been so far.
          There could be significantly greater reasons why many of us are limiting our relativities in this light even than pertain to the language of <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>.
          However, I am beginning to enjoy a slowly noticeable advantage by making choices that give preference to the living of life in the visible and describable world.
        </div>
      </section>
      <br><hr style="width: 50%"><br>
      <section>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          This new practice I’m adopting means I have to look around me more and find stories that already have some descriptiveness to them, some recognizeable substance from which to build further connectivity.
          There will also be plenty of emerging tellable story as the “powers that be” give of the borders to the invisible world the quality of developable manifestation for our visible world.
          Simply put, I’m looking at becoming stronger at making my own statements of belief about what life is worth and what its utility might be in the creative direction, often without knowing, until my neighbors respond, whether and how they like me expressing my opinion or communicating my interest.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          In some cases, there could be offenses taken by those of various faiths whose ideas about reality define specific limitations my own visions might seem to challenge.
          Another situation of significance involves my sense that many of the mythologies of Earth connect with our own level of it in ways that are comparable to religion, and when what we mean by mythology includes modern day production of literature and art (like video), copyrights affect the elaboration of commentary.
          And, of course, any visions that urge us to speak to our own associates about possibly mutual truths might spark tensions that, if unchecked, can lead to strong measures of lifestyle adjustment, which I found when I lost employment and then further liberties when I was accused of cyberstalking.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Still, I mean to further my own ascension pathway, the emphasis of which is the betterment of quality of life.
          I just have to keep learning how to improve my respect for anyone I interact with or even reference as I express what I initially think might be important or helpful to express.
          Slowly, through the years, I have seen myself learn, though many of the lessons have been very difficult, so I have great faith of my own that the essence of what I’m trying to do is right.
