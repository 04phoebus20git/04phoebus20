              Apophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God.
              It forms a pair together with <a href="#cataphasis">cataphatic theology</a>,
              which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God <i>is</i>.
              <br><br>
              The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.

              Cataphatic theology or kataphatic theology is theology that uses “positive” terminology to describe or refer to the divine – specifically, God – i.e. terminology that describes or refers to what the divine is believed to be, in contrast to the “negative” terminology used in <a href="#apophasis">apophatic theology</a> to indicate what it is believed the divine is not.

                Dextromethorphan, or DXM, is a cough suppressant found in over-the-counter medications.
                It has also been used recreationally for at least 30 years, without much harm or publicity.
                Although chemically related to opiates, its effects are closest to ketamine’s.
                In addition to suppressing coughs, DXM is used medically for diagnostic purposes, and may be useful for a variety of conditions from seizures to heroin addiction.
                In the brain, DXM blocks the dopamine reuptake site, activates the sigma receptor, and blocks the open NMDA channel.
                (None of these effects are permanent).

                this is the modern-day formulation of the fabled “nectar of immortality” - <span style="font-size: medium">अमृत</span> (amṛ́ta) or ἀμβροσῐ́ᾱ (ambrosíā)

            <dd>
              An obstruent is a speech sound such as [k], [d͡ʒ], or [f] that is formed by <i>obstructing</i> airflow.
              Obstruents contrast with sonorants, which have no such obstruction and so resonate.
              All obstruents are consonants, but sonorants include both vowels and consonants.
              <br><br>
              Obstruents are subdivided into plosives (oral stops), such as [p, t, k, b, d, ɡ], with complete occlusion of the vocal tract, often followed by a release burst; fricatives, such as [f, s, ʃ, x, v, z, ʒ, ɣ], with limited closure, not stopping airflow but making it turbulent; and affricates, which begin with complete occlusion but then release into a fricative-like release, such as [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ].
              <br><br>
              Obstruents are prototypically voiceless, but voiced obstruents are common. This contrasts with sonorants, which are prototypically voiced and only rarely voiceless.

            <br>
            <dd>
              In phonetics and phonology, a sonorant or resonant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow in the vocal tract; these are the manners of articulation that are most often voiced in the world's languages.
              Vowels are sonorants, as are consonants like /m/ and /l/: approximants, nasals, flaps or taps, and most trills.
              <br><br>
              In older usage, only the term <i>resonant</i> was used with this meaning, and sonorant was a narrower term, referring to all resonants except vowels and semivowels.
              <br><br>
              Whereas obstruents are frequently voiceless, sonorants are almost always voiced. A typical sonorant consonant inventory found in many languages comprises the following: two nasals /m/, /n/, two semivowels /w/, /j/, and two liquids /l/, /r/.

            <dd>
              Ahimsa means ‘not to injure’ and ‘compassion’ and refers to a key virtue in Hinduism and Jainism.
              The word is derived from the Sanskrit root <i>hiṃs</i> – to strike; <i>hiṃsā</i> is injury or harm, <i>a-hiṃsā</i> is the opposite of this, i.e. cause no injury, do no harm.
              Ahimsa is also referred to as nonviolence, and it applies to all living beings—including all animals—in ancient Indian religions.
              <br><br>
              Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of Jainism and Hinduism, and in Buddhism where it is the first of the five precepts.
              Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself.
              Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences.
              While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.
              Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of <i>ahimsa</i>.

              Om, also written as Aum, is the most sacred syllable symbol and mantra of Brahman, the Almighty God in Hinduism.
              Brahman is Supreme Self, Ultimate Reality, Creator of all Existence.
              The syllable is often chanted either independently or before a mantra;
              it signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or Atma.
              The Om sound is the primordial sound and is called the Shabda-Brahman (Brahman as sound).
              <br><br>
              Om is part of the iconography found in ancient and medieval era manuscripts, temples, monasteries and spiritual retreats in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
              The symbol has a spiritual meaning in all Indian dharmas, but the meaning and connotations of Om vary between the diverse schools within and across the various traditions.

              They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as “hungry ghost” from the Chinese adaptation.
