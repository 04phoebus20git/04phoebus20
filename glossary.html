              Apophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God.
              It forms a pair together with
              <a href="#cataphasis">
                cataphatic theology</a>,
              which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God <i>is</i>.
              <br><br>
              The apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.

              Cataphatic theology or kataphatic theology is theology that uses “positive” terminology to describe or refer to the divine – specifically, God – i.e. terminology that describes or refers to what the divine is believed to be, in contrast to the “negative” terminology used in
              <a href="#apophasis">
                apophatic theology</a>
              to indicate what it is believed the divine is not.

            <br>
            <dd>
              An obstruent is a speech sound such as [k], [d͡ʒ], or [f] that is formed by <i>obstructing</i> airflow.
              Obstruents contrast with sonorants, which have no such obstruction and so resonate.
              All obstruents are consonants, but sonorants include both vowels and consonants.
              <br><br>
              Obstruents are subdivided into plosives (oral stops), such as [p, t, k, b, d, ɡ], with complete occlusion of the vocal tract, often followed by a release burst; fricatives, such as [f, s, ʃ, x, v, z, ʒ, ɣ], with limited closure, not stopping airflow but making it turbulent; and affricates, which begin with complete occlusion but then release into a fricative-like release, such as [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ].
              <br><br>
              Obstruents are prototypically voiceless, but voiced obstruents are common. This contrasts with sonorants, which are prototypically voiced and only rarely voiceless.

            <br>
            <dd>
              In phonetics and phonology, a sonorant or resonant is a speech sound that is produced with continuous, non-turbulent airflow in the vocal tract; these are the manners of articulation that are most often voiced in the world's languages.
              Vowels are sonorants, as are consonants like /m/ and /l/: approximants, nasals, flaps or taps, and most trills.
              <br><br>
              In older usage, only the term <i>resonant</i> was used with this meaning, and sonorant was a narrower term, referring to all resonants except vowels and semivowels.
              <br><br>
              Whereas obstruents are frequently voiceless, sonorants are almost always voiced. A typical sonorant consonant inventory found in many languages comprises the following: two nasals /m/, /n/, two semivowels /w/, /j/, and two liquids /l/, /r/.

              Preta also known as hungry ghost, is the Sanskrit name for a type of supernatural being described in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Chinese and Vietnamese folk religion as undergoing suffering greater than that of humans, particularly an extreme level of hunger and thirst.
              They have their origins in Indian religions and have been adopted into East Asian religions via the spread of Buddhism. Preta is often translated into English as “hungry ghost” from the Chinese adaptation.
