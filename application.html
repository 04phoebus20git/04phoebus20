          In the context of using one’s mouth and one’s digestive tract, the “affirmation” is, for those of us who have at least so much as animal form (if you’re reading this, I assume you’re a homo sapien of some sort), a quality of digestive strength by which anything we claw at (often using metallic forks if we’re typical humans) and then chew can then be swallowed and made use of chemically by one’s body for energy or growth.
          The varieties of foods that we can eat make for a variety of ways to experience the chemical world, and mostly we think that’s ok, even if we had to kill some lives in order to swallow their then edible bodies into our stomachs.
          Death is a significant factor in the judgment of quality of life, and for that reason, many people on Earth choose vegetarian or otherwise limited diets, hoping that karma or God or conscientiousness will be merciful in thanks for our willing efforts to exercise mercy.
