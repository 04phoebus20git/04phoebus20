          In the context of using one’s mouth and one’s digestive tract, the “affirmation” is, for those of us who have at least so much as animal form (if you’re reading this, I assume you’re a homo sapien of some sort), a quality of digestive strength by which anything we claw at (often using metallic forks if we’re typical humans) and then chew can then be swallowed and made use of chemically by one’s body for energy or growth.
          The varieties of foods that we eat make for a variety of ways to experience the chemical world, and mostly we think that’s ok, even if we had to kill some lives in order to swallow their then edible bodies into our stomachs.
          Death is a significant factor in the judgment of quality of life, and for that reason, many people on Earth choose vegetarian or otherwise limited diets, hoping that karma or God or conscientiousness will be merciful in thanks for our own willing efforts to exercise mercy.

          The next context of using one’s mouth makes a partnership with one’s heart, at least that’s a typical sense of what sonorancy is.
          Eastern culture has a simple mantra <i>oṃ</i>
          <span style="font-size: small">
            (&#2384;)</span>
          or <i>auṃ</i>, where its <i>a</i> is the most open of the vowels and its <i>u</i> is the furthest back of the vowels.
          The anusvara, or nasal <i>ṃ</i>, is a type of simplest sonorant also, and so the sound of <i>oṃ</i> altogether is in essence the origin of sonorancy itself as it rises from within one’s heart up to and out of the mouth.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          This vowelic affirmation is like the fire of digestion, and of course the many languages of Earth use many vowels, but sonorancy is the gift of life that its level has to give, as we hear in the expressions of the animals and with even greater elaboration amongst humans.
          Articulators (lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum, uvula, glottis, and the tongue) give a vast array of plosive and fricative consonantal adjustments we can make to the initial vowelic uprising.
          Combinations of sonorants and obstruents are thereby used to address and reference the scope of life that we love to interact with at heart level.

          Jainists and Buddhists both have as a primary ethical principle what they call </i>ahiṃsā</>, or intentional non-violence, and while this is how they refer to their justifications of dietary limitation, they also apply the principle to speech and thought.
          The commitment to not harming others, animal or human, is very integral to their lifestyle, and so they carefully protect their spoken words, and the audiences those words would affect, from spefication such as would create any harm.
          Many of us in this world would find challenge enough merely controlling our dietary urges, yet we can probably recognize that insult and threat amongst humans can trigger more severe failures even than chemical death is; too many humans suffer from aspects and degrees of insanity due to wrongful misuse of speech.
